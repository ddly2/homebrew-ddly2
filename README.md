## Background
> Homebrewâ€™s versions are not intended to be used for any old versions you personally require for your project. You should create your own tap for formulae you or your organisation wish to control the versioning of or those that do not meet the above standards. Software that has regular API or ABI breaking releases still needs to meet all the above requirements; that a brew upgrade has broken something for you is not an argument for us to add and maintain a formula for you.
